22431	If an Item is CHANGED but the updated version is disappearing , it creates a conflicting case . Since a view that is marked as disappearing is likely to be going out of bounds , we run a change animation . Both views will be cleaned automatically once their animations finish . On the other hand , if it is the same view holder instance , we run a disappearing animation instead because we are not going to rebind the updated VH unless it is enforced by the layout manager .
70010	2 3 - bytes chars + 3 bytes header .
32087	For TLS 1 . 2 , we no longer use the certificate _ types field from the CertificateRequest message to directly determine the SSLPossession .

66540	in JavaFX the implementation class of most ReadOnlyProperty < Throwable > instances in Service / Task are actually of type ObjectProperty < Throwable > and therefor can be casted so that we are able to bind them . This is a dependency to an implementation detail of JavaFX but at the moment there is no other way of achieving the desired behavior .

17342	Check if we need to clear out old entries from the cache . isCleaning variable is checked instead of markAndSweepLock . isLocked ( ) for performance because every put invocation will check until the size is back to an acceptable level . There is a race between the check and the call to markAndSweep , but it ' s unimportant because markAndSweep actually acquires the lock or returns if it can ' t . Thread safety note : isCleaning read is piggybacked ( comes after ) other volatile reads in this method .

40404	This is the handling for some default action . Note that for backwards compatibility we don ' t do this default handling if explicit ime options have not been given , instead turning this into the normal enter key codes that an app may be expecting .
47795	we only flush here if it ' s really really needed - try to minimize the impact of the read operation in some cases ie . a tragic event we might still be able to read the relevant value which is not really important in production but some test can make most strict assumptions if we don ' t fail in this call unless absolutely necessary .
5229	Check that the file has an extension we care about before trying to read out of it .
46898	We set the viewtype so if the user presses back when they are done editing the controller knows we were in the Edit Event screen . Likewise for eventId
27535	If thread stopping is enabled , executor threads should have been stopped above when the executor was shut down but that depends on the thread correctly handling the interrupt .

5075	avro deserialization may throw AvroRuntimeException , NullPointerException , etc
61694	As we set max space for logs to 7KB , then we expect storing data with 2 ' longLine ' ( which , given UTF - 8 is used , will be ~ 2 * 1KB ) to succeed . We then expect subsequent attempt to store data with ' tooLongLine ' ( ~ 6KB ) to fail . We also expect that logfile created by first fakeLogger ( ' test1 ' id ) will be removed as otherwise data from last logger would not fit . Note that code sending already stored offline logs will be triggered by the first log ( ) as it succeeds , but further failing log ( ) ( and initiating storing ) will stop sending . Hence , no logs will be deleted due to the sending routine .
29154	Second is the key
26158	Wait as long as necessary for stacks

36517	541867 When a message is unlocked , a registered ConsumerDispatcher will try to deliver it to a ready consumer . When this happens the consumer will register for the UNLOCK event . If that is added to a later slot ( e . g . UNLOCKED _ 3 ) than the one that ' s currently being processed ( the ConsumerDispatcher ) it is possible for us to drive the new consumer ' s unlock event straight away ( even though the message has just been locked ) .
9099	Zipkin and B3 originally used the same span ID between client and server . Some instrumentation are inconsistent about adding the shared flag on the server side . Since we have the entire trace , and it is ordered client - first , we can correct a missing shared flag .

50488	Ghetto indentation ( trying , but not too hard , to not look too bad )
24914	This is the magic and invisible " . " at the head of every match pattern , and corresponds to the current node in the context list , from where predicates are counted . So , in order to calculate " foo [ 3 ] " , it has to count from the current node in the context list , so , from that current node , the full pattern is really " self : : node ( ) / child : : foo [ 3 ] " . If you translate this to a select pattern from the node being tested , which is really how we ' re treating match patterns , it works out to self : : foo / parent : : node [ child : : foo [ 3 ] ] " , or close enough .
33386	We have two possibilities here : 1 . we are writing the indexed image with bitfields compression ( this covers also the case of BYTE _ BINARY ) = > use icm to get actual RGB color values . 2 . we are writing the gray - scaled image with BI _ BITFIELDS compression = > just replicate the level of gray to color components .

38752	Now construct the two LogFileHandle objects that manage the individual log files . There is a bug in the HP JVM ' s NIO implementation that causes it to fail when an attempt to expand the mapped files is made . To overcome this when running on HP the log files must be opened at their configured maximum size so that they will an attempt to expand them will never be made .
